Project: INTAKE - Calorie Tracker

Description:
INTAKE is a web application that allows users to select meals from a predefined list, input the calorie amount for each selected meal, and calculate the total calories consumed during the day.

Approach:

Project Conceptualization:

Chose a calorie tracking theme.
Defined JavaScript objects to represent meals and their calorie information.
Used array functions like filter and reduce to manipulate and process data.
Setting Up the Environment:

Created the necessary files: index.html, style.css, and index.js.
Structured the code into functions and modules as needed.
Developing JavaScript Objects:

Defined a meals array with meal objects, each containing an id, name, and calories.
Implementing Array Functions:

Used array functions (filter, reduce, forEach) to handle meal selections and calorie calculations.
Applying Best Practices:

Followed coding best practices: readable, maintainable, and efficient code.
Commented the code thoroughly to explain the logic and approach.
Testing and Debugging:

Tested the application thoroughly to ensure correct data manipulation.
Debugged issues and refined the code as necessary.
Functions Used:
createMealElements:

Creates dynamic HTML elements to display meals and collect user input.
Uses the forEach array function to iterate over the meals array.
calculateTotalCalories:

Calculates the total calories based on user input and selection.
Uses the filter function to get selected meals and the reduce function to sum the calories.
Challenges:
Handling dynamic updates of meal calorie values.
Ensuring efficient data processing and manipulation.
Making the UI visually appealing with colorful styling.
